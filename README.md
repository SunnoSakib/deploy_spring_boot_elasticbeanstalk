# Spring Boot Application Deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Terraform

This repository provides a Terraform script for deploying a Spring Boot application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The script automates the provisioning and configuration of the Elastic Beanstalk environment, making it easy to deploy and manage your application in a scalable and reliable manner.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform script, ensure that you have the following:

- An AWS account and access credentials with appropriate permissions.
- The Terraform CLI installed on your local machine.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to deploy your Spring Boot application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Terraform:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```shell
cd spring-boot-elasticbeanstalk-terraform
```

3. Open the `deploy_spring_boot_elasticbeanstalk.tf` file and customize the configuration based on your requirements. Update the AWS region, application name, bucket name, key, and other parameters as needed.

4. Save the changes to the `deploy_spring_boot_elasticbeanstalk.tf` file.

5. Initialize the Terraform workspace.

```shell
terraform init
```

6. Review the execution plan to ensure that the desired resources will be created.

```shell
terraform plan
```

7. Deploy the Spring Boot application to Elastic Beanstalk by running the following command:

```shell
terraform apply
```

8. Once the deployment is complete, Terraform will output the URL of the deployed application. Use this URL to access your running Spring Boot application.

9. To destroy the resources and terminate the Elastic Beanstalk environment, run:

```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Terraform script according to your specific requirements. You can modify the Elastic Beanstalk environment configuration, instance type, solution stack, environment variables, and other aspects of the deployment process.

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and understand the implications of the changes before modifying the script.
